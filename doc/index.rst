.. warning::

   This is still work in progress, and has not been officially launched
   yet. But there are some nice pictures, though.


Welcome to the Tech:Online hub!

What is Tech:Online?
====================

Tech:Online is a network-hacking event and experiment!

We had to cancel The Gathering, but would otherwise have gathered over 5000
people under the same roof for some digital hilarities. For many of us, The
Gathering is an amazing opportunity to learn and experiment.

Tech:Online is a realization that *we can still learn and experiment*, and
even better, we can invite YOU to take part!

Do you have what it takes to set up a LAN? Or do you want to learn as much
as possible!

The event takes place during the Easter holiday. The target date is Friday
the 10th of April. It will be preceded by a introduction to basic LAN
networking the day before, and mentors will be available throughout the
event to help you and guide you.

During the event, you as a participant will be given remote access to a
raspberry pie (or similar) that is hooked up directly with 4 switches,
using console cables. The four switches are connected similar to how we
would do things at The Gathering, and your task is to get the "participant"
online.

The setup will look similar to this:

The task is split into different parts with clear feedback of your progress
and hints as to what to do next. There's also a decent amount of relevant
documentation available, so we hope most participants will be able to
finish, and also learn a ton!

Who can participate?
====================

Anyone!

If you are interested in networking, this is for you. While we want to make
this accessible to absolutely everyone, you do need some prior knowledge:

- You need to be able to use an ssh client, and have some experience
  running very basic commands.
- You must know what an IP address is, and it's also helpful if you know
  what a gateway address is.
- Some knowledge of very basic routing is helpful. You do not need
  practical experience with it - that's why we're here.
- Reading.

Will I get a diploma?
=====================

No idea! Do you want one? If you want one, I'm sure we can make one.

How much time do I have?
========================

No idea! All we know is the date, but we can extend the event if there's
enough interest in it. We do not want you to feel pressed for time. The
exact time will be posted here when it's available.

How do I track progress?
========================

We've set up a status page that runs a number of checks in the background
and gives you reasonably rapid feedback (30-60 second delay). In addition
to that, there's a webcam pointed at the rig to make it interesting,
including a computer simulating an end-user.

You will also get the practical experience through the event to track
progress yourself.

Great, how do I sign up?
========================

Errrrrrrrrr, we're working on it!

Come back in a few days? Hopefully, you'll be using unicorn.

Either way, you should join our discord server, though.
https://discord.gg/E58dr7c should work for invites. We hang out in the
"#tech" channel.

Prizes? Did you say prizes?
===========================

Yes I did!

We have three tickets for The Gathering 2021 to hand out to a lucky few who
impress us in some way or an other. And there might be other surprises...

To get a chance to grab a ticket, we have a few categories in mind:

- Time to target: Finish in the shortest amount of time
- Rookie of the year: The youngest and/or least experienced participant to
  finish
- Wildcard: Impress us! Set up something cool, be super-helpful to others,
  or just plain impress us in some way or an other!

Either way, if you do participate, you're invited to a guided tour of the
network infrastructure at The Gathering 2021! (except if there's like a
thousand people participating, then I might have to rethink that decision)

WHY? Why not virtual?
=====================

"You're crazy, you can just as easily do all this virtual!"

Bah, virtual is BORING.

Yes, it's completely possible to do all of this in a virtual environment,
but I figured it's much more fun to know that you're working witch actual
hardware, with actual practical concerns such as how to get console access
and cable routing and such. And to get to feel how slow a reboot on a
switch really is.

But mostly, it's just far more fun to do this with physical equipment. And
we do have a couple of hundred switches that are otherwise unused.
