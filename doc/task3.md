There are two edge-switches, so now you get to do the previous task all
over again.  Instead of repeating the instructions, here's a tip:

`show configuration interfaces | display set` can be used to extract
set-statements, edit (in vim/notepad/whatever), and paste it back in. Just
remember to modify the IP addresses!

By the end of this task, all three switches should be fully connected,
everything should verify correctly, except that the client FOO is still not
on-line.
